## There are two ways to write DP
1. first being Top-Down approach----> Recursion+ Memoisation
2. second being Bottom-Up approach ---> tabulation (converting recursion in loop format)

   1. Tabulation me first base case use krke data dalo
   2. Then use kha se kha tk loop chahiye
   3. write the code


## Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs
 ### Before this a basic question
 Starting from the ith stair, tell the possible number of way to climb the stairs(variation of this) [done by recursion ]


## Actual Question:
  1. Every stair is associated with some cost
  2. So find the min cost to reach the end starting from either 0th or 1st Stair
  3. Return the min cost to reach the top floor
